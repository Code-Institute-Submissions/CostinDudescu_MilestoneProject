# Costin Dudescu - Styling Your Home

This project came from the necessity of publishing and creating a website around the work of art of Costin Dudescu 
and that is of building, designing and refurbishing old homes or abandoned houses into living spaces where people spend
most of their lives.
The projects are coming alive and are tailored according to the character of the owners and based on the laws of Harmony
found everywhere in Nature.

## UX

The website was created for Costin Dudescu, to show his work through pictures, and for the visitors of his site that are interested in refurbishing their
old homes or want to build new ones, but they want something to stand out and be a reflection of their character.

My idea for creating the site evolved from the projects of Costin Dudescu and also using a minimalist approach in the design
of the site. The core elements are the pictures of projects like the dicton "a picture is worth a thousand words".
I focused on selecting some of the best pictures to showcase what it can be done  for the visitors and potential customers
to enjoy, firstly, watching this projects coming alive, but also, secondly, to inspire them and possibly redesign their homes.

###### User stories

**Alexandra** 
 - As a user, I want to be able to understand from the first page what the site is about
  and how can it help me to build my house, which is the the first thing that made me visit this site.
 I want to be able to see some of the projects of Costin Dudescu and also to find out about him and his story, so that
I can make my mind if to call him and use his services or not.

**Alin**

 - As a user experiencing the first time this site, it seemed very well adjusted to my mobile
  Iphone5, and I was able to navigate easily through the pages and read the content. 
  As a software tester working in Bucharest, I didn't find any problems testing the site 
  at different resolutions and I was impressed with Costin's work.

## Technologies Used

 [HTML 5](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_intro.asp) 
 
 To create the skeleton for the web pages of the project.
 
 [CSS3](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp)
 
 To style the HTML elements.
 
 [Bootstrap 4.1.3](https://getbootstrap.com/) 
 
 Framework to create the project, using the responsive grid system they use, mobile-first, and
 other classes for elements used in this project.
 
 [JavaScript](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/javascript/)
 
 Used JavaScript for the hamburger menu (navbar-toggler) for the responsive menu on mobile from 992px and below. 
 
 ## Testing
 
 The testing process was conducted with Google's Chrome responsive tools, by launching the project in the first of bootstrap's breakpoint, XS, viewing how the elements on
 that page work (the links are targeting the correct pages, the selected images that are nested in the anchors work and open the bigger image(s))
 behave and arrange themselves , choosing from the UX point of view the best arrangament, modyfing classes, adding or removing classes from bootstrap or using my own style, and then proceeding through
 the next breakpoint , repeating the same process up to bootstrap's XL breakpoint.
 
 After each test with Google's Chrome dev tools, I deployed my respective page (e.g. index.html)
 to GitHub repository, and the GitHub pages so as to view my respective page on my mobile and see how it behaves.
 
 The process's pattern went on for the other page's of the project, namely *about.html, projects.html and contact.html*
 until I was sattisfied with the final version.

 ## Deployment
 
 The project is deployed to the platform GitHub Pages.
 After creating a local repository, I have mainly pushed the pages (index, about, projects and contact) and the other files(css,images and readme),
 after adding the content, styling and testing  of the main pages.
