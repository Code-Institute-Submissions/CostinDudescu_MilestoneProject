## Costin Dudescu - Styling Your Home

This project came from the necessity of publishing and creating a website around the work of art of Costin Dudescu 
and that is of building, designing and refurbishing old homes or abandoned houses into living spaces where people spend
most of their lives.
The projects are coming alive and are tailored according to the character of the owners and based on the laws of Harmony
found everywhere in Nature.

#UX

The website was created for Costin Dudescu, to show his work through pictures, and for the visitors of his site that are interested in refurbishing their
old homes or want to build new ones, but they want something to stand out and be a reflection of their character.

My idea for creating the site evolved from the projects of Costin Dudescu and also using a minimalist approach in the design
of the site. The core elements are the pictures of projects and like the saying "a picture is worth a thousand words", 
I focused on selecting some of the best pictures to showcase what it can be done and for the visitors and potential customers
to enjoy, firstly, watching this projects coming alive, but also, secondly, to inspire them and possibly redesign their homes.
